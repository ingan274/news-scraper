## Technologies Used  
* Mongoose
* Cheerio 
* Bootstrap 4
* Handlebars
* ES6

## Areas for Further Development
* More robust article information, including images, publication dates, etc.
* The ability to see the full article when click in to the article to see the notes
* a date for when a note was posted
* Adding in a "next page" or "load more" feature when there are more than a certain number of articles in the database.
* Users should have to create accounts and sign in to use all the features of the site. This will allow for...
    1. individual users to have their own individual set of saved articles.
    2. notes to be visibly associated with a username.
    3. users to only be able to delete their own notes.


###### Happy Reading!
